---

## [1.4.1] — 2026-02-23

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Endpoint Page Cleanup** — Removed redundant API Key Management section from Endpoint page (now fully managed in the dedicated API Manager page)
- **CI/CD** — Added `deploy-vps.yml` workflow for automatic VPS deployment on new releases

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-02-23

> ### ✨ Feature Release — Dedicated API Key Manager with Model Permissions
>
> Community-contributed API Key Manager page with model-level access control, enhanced with usage statistics, key status indicators, and improved UX.

### ✨ New Features

- **Dedicated API Key Manager** — New `/dashboard/api-manager` page for managing API keys, extracted from the Endpoint page. Includes create, delete, and permissions management with a clean table UI ([PR #118](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/pull/118) by [@nyatoru](https://github.com/nyatoru))
- **Model-Level API Key Permissions** — Restrict API keys to specific models using `allowed_models` with wildcard pattern support (e.g., `openai/*`). Toggle between "Allow All" and "Restrict" modes with an intuitive provider-grouped model selector
- **API Key Validation Cache** — 3-tier caching layer (validation, metadata, permission) reduces database hits on every request, with automatic cache invalidation on key changes
- **Usage Statistics Per Key** — Each API key shows total request count and last used timestamp, with a stats summary dashboard (total keys, restricted keys, total requests, models available)
- **Key Status Indicators** — Color-coded lock/unlock icons and copy buttons on each key row for quick identification of restricted vs unrestricted keys

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Endpoint Page Simplified** — API key management removed from Endpoint page and replaced with a prominent link to the API Manager
- **Sidebar Navigation** — New "API Manager" entry with `vpn_key` icon in the sidebar
- **Prepared Statements** — API key database operations now use cached prepared statements for better performance
- **Input Validation** — XSS-safe sanitization and regex validation for key names; ID format validation for API calls

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-02-23

> ### 🐛 Bugfix Release — Proxy Connection Tests & Compatible Provider Display
>
> Fixes provider connection tests bypassing configured proxy and improves compatible provider display in the request logger.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Connection Tests Now Use Proxy** — Provider connection tests (`Test Connection` button) now route through the configured proxy (key → combo → provider → global → direct), matching the behavior of real API calls. Previously, `fetch()` was called directly, bypassing the proxy entirely ([#119](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/119))
- **Compatible Provider Display in Logs** — OpenAI/Anthropic compatible providers now show friendly labels (`OAI-COMPAT`, `ANT-COMPAT`) instead of raw UUID-based IDs in the request logger's provider column, dropdown, and quick filters ([#113](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/113))

### 🧪 Tests

- **Connection Test Unit Tests** — 26 new test cases covering error classification logic, token expiry detection, and provider display label resolution

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-02-23

> ### ✨ Feature Release — iFlow Fix, Health Check Logs Toggle, Kilocode Models & Model Deduplication
>
> Community-driven release with iFlow HMAC-SHA256 signature support, health check log management, expanded Kilocode model list, and model deduplication on the dashboard.

### ✨ New Features

- **Hide Health Check Logs** — New toggle in Settings → Appearance to suppress verbose `[HealthCheck]` messages from the server console. Uses a 30-second cache to minimize database reads with request coalescing for concurrent calls ([PR #111](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/pull/111) by [@nyatoru](https://github.com/nyatoru))
- **Kilocode Custom Models Endpoint** — Added `modelsUrl` support in `RegistryEntry` for providers with non-standard model endpoints. Expanded Kilocode model list from 8 to 26 models including Qwen3, GPT-5, Claude 3 Haiku, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek V3, Llama 4, and more ([PR #115](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/pull/115) by [@benzntech](https://github.com/benzntech))

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **iFlow 406 Error** — Created dedicated `IFlowExecutor` with HMAC-SHA256 signature support (`session-id`, `x-iflow-timestamp`, `x-iflow-signature` headers). The iFlow provider was previously using the default executor which lacked the required signature headers, causing 406 errors ([#114](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/114))
- **Duplicate Models in Endpoint Lists** — Filtered out parent models (`!m.parent`) from all model categorization and count logic on the Endpoint page. Provider modal lists also exclude duplicates ([PR #112](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/pull/112) by [@nyatoru](https://github.com/nyatoru))

### 🧪 Tests

- **IFlowExecutor Unit Tests** — 11 new test cases covering HMAC-SHA256 signature generation, header building, URL construction, body passthrough, and executor registry integration

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-02-22

> ### ✨ Feature Release — Dashboard Session Auth for Models Endpoint
>
> Dashboard users can now access `/v1/models` via their existing session when API key auth is required.

### ✨ New Features

- **JWT Session Auth Fallback** — When `requireAuthForModels` is enabled, the `/v1/models` endpoint now accepts both API key (Bearer token) for external clients **and** the dashboard JWT session cookie (`auth_token`), allowing logged-in dashboard users to view models without needing an explicit API key ([PR #110](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/pull/110) by [@nyatoru](https://github.com/nyatoru))

### 🔧 Improvements

- **401 instead of 404** — Authentication failures on `/v1/models` now return `401 Unauthorized` with a structured JSON error body (OpenAI-compatible format) instead of a generic `404 Not Found`, improving debuggability for API clients
- **Simplified auth logic** — Refactored the JWT cookie verification to reuse the same pattern as `apiAuth.ts`, removing redundant same-origin detection (~60 lines) since the `sameSite:lax` + `httpOnly` cookie flags already provide equivalent CSRF protection

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-02-22

> ### 🐛 Bugfix Release — API Key Creation & Codex Team Plan Quotas
>
> Fixes API key creation crash when `API_KEY_SECRET` is not set and adds Code Review rate limit window to Codex quota display.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **API Key Creation** — Added deterministic fallback for `API_KEY_SECRET` to prevent `crypto.createHmac` crash when the environment variable is not configured. Keys created without the secret are insecure (warned at startup) but the application no longer crashes ([#108](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/108))
- **Codex Code Review Quota** — Added parsing of the third rate limit window (`code_review_rate_limit`) from the ChatGPT usage API, supporting Plus/Pro/Team plan differences. The dashboard now displays all three quota bars: Session (5h), Weekly, and Code Review ([#106](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/106))

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-02-21

> ### 🐛 Bugfix Release — OAuth Client Secret and Codex Business Quotas
>
> Fixes missing remote-server OAuth configurations and adds ChatGPT Business account quota monitoring.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **OAuth Client Secret** — Omitted explicitly empty `client_secret` parameters to resolve token exchange connection rejection on remote servers missing environment variables for Antigravity, Gemini and iFlow ([#103](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/103))
- **Codex Business Quotas** — Automatically fetches the appropriate ChatGPT workspace to unlock the 5-hour Business usage limits directly inside the Quota tab and mapped `BIZ` string variant perfectly ([#101](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/101))

---

## [1.0.10] — 2026-02-21

> ### 🐛 Bugfix — Multi-Account Support for Qwen
>
> Solves the issue where adding a second Qwen account would overwrite the first one.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **OAuth Accounts** — Extracted user email from the `id_token` using JWT decoding for Qwen and similar providers, allowing multiple accounts of the same provider to be authenticated simultaneously instead of triggering the fallback overwrite logic ([#99](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/99))

---

## [1.0.9] — 2026-02-21

> ### 🐛 Hotfix — Settings Persistence
>
> Fixes blocked providers and API auth toggle not being saved after page reload.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Settings Persistence** — Added `requireAuthForModels` (boolean) and `blockedProviders` (string array) to the Zod validation schema, which was silently stripping these fields during PATCH requests, preventing them from being saved to the database

---

## [1.0.8] — 2026-02-21

> ### 🔒 API Security & Windows Support
>
> Adds API Endpoint Protection for `/models`, Windows server startup fixes, and UI improvements.

### ✨ New Features

- **API Endpoint Protection (`/models`)** — New Security Tab settings to optionally require an API key for the `/v1/models` endpoint (returns 404 when unauthorized) and to selectively block specific providers from appearing in the models list ([#100](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/100), [#96](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/96))
- **Interactive Provider UI** — Blocked Providers setting features an interactive chip selector with visual badges for all available AI providers

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Windows Server Startup** — Fixed `ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH` crash on Windows by safely wrapping `import.meta.url` resolution with a fallback to `process.cwd()` for globally installed npm packages ([#98](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/98))
- **Combo buttons visibility** — Fixed layout overlap and tight spacing for the Quick Action buttons (Clone / Delete / Test) on the Combos page on narrower screens ([#95](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/95))

---

## [1.0.7] — 2026-02-20

> ### 🐛 Bugfix Release — OpenAI Compatibility, Custom Models & OAuth UX
>
> Fixes three community-reported issues: stream default now follows OpenAI spec, custom OpenAI-compatible providers appear in `/v1/models`, and Google OAuth shows a clear error + tutorial for remote deployments.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`stream` defaults to `false`** — Aligns with the OpenAI specification which explicitly states `stream` defaults to `false`. Previously OmniRoute defaulted to `true`, causing SSE data to be returned instead of a JSON object, breaking clients like Spacebot, OpenCode, and standard Python/Rust/Go OpenAI SDKs that don't explicitly set `stream: true` ([#89](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/89))
- **Custom AI providers now appear in `/v1/models`** — OpenAI-compatible custom providers (e.g. FriendLI) whose provider ID wasn't in the built-in alias map were silently excluded from the models list even when active. Fixed by also checking the raw provider ID from the database against active connections ([#90](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/90))
- **OAuth `redirect_uri_mismatch` — improved UX for remote deployments** — Google OAuth providers (Antigravity, Gemini CLI) now always use `localhost` as redirect URI matching the registered credentials. Remote-access users see a targeted amber warning with a link to the new setup guide. The token exchange error message explains the root cause and guides users to configure their own credentials ([#91](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/91))

### 📖 Documentation

- **OAuth em Servidor Remoto tutorial** — New README section with step-by-step guide to configure custom Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 credentials for remote/VPS/Docker deployments
- **`.env.example` Google OAuth block** — Added prominent warning block explaining remote credential requirements with direct links to Google Cloud Console

## [1.0.6] — 2026-02-20

> ### ✨ Provider & Combo Toggles — Strict Model Filtering
>
> `/v1/models` now shows only models from providers with active connections. Combos and providers can be toggled on/off directly from the dashboard.

### ✨ New Features

- **Provider toggle on Providers page** — Enable/disable all connections for a provider directly from the main Providers list. Toggle is always visible, no hover needed
- **Combo enable/disable toggle** — Each combo on the Combos page now has a toggle. Disabled combos are excluded from `/v1/models`
- **OAuth private IP support** — Expanded localhost detection to include private/LAN IPs (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x`) for correct OAuth redirect URIs

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`/v1/models` strict filtering** — Models are now shown only from providers with active, enabled connections. Previously, if no connections existed or all were disabled, all 378+ models were shown as a fallback
- **Disabled provider models hidden** — Toggling off a provider immediately removes its models from `/v1/models`

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-02-20

> ### 🐛 Hotfix — Model Filtering & Docker DATA_DIR
>
> Filters all model types in `/v1/models` by active providers and fixes Docker data directory mismatch.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`/v1/models` full filtering** — Embedding, image, rerank, audio, and moderation models are now filtered by active provider connections, matching chat model behavior. Providers like Together AI no longer appear without a configured API key (#88)
- **Docker `DATA_DIR`** — Added `ENV DATA_DIR=/app/data` to Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` ensuring the volume mount always matches the app data directory — prevents empty database on container recreation

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-02-19

> ### 🔧 Provider Filtering, OAuth Proxy Fix & Documentation
>
> Dashboard model filtering by active providers, provider enable/disable visual indicators, OAuth login fix for nginx reverse proxy, and LLM onboarding documentation.

### ✨ Features

- **API Models filtering** — `GET /api/models` now returns only models from active providers; use `?all=true` for all models (#85)
- **Provider disabled indicator** — Provider cards show ⏸ "Disabled" badge with reduced opacity when all connections are inactive (#85)
- **`llm.txt`** — Comprehensive LLM onboarding file with project overview, architecture, flows, and conventions (#84)
- **WhatsApp Community** — Added WhatsApp group link to README badges and Support section

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **OAuth behind nginx** — Fixed OAuth login failing when behind a reverse proxy by using `window.location.origin` for redirect URI instead of hardcoded `localhost` (#86)
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` for OAuth** — Documented env var usage as redirect URI override for proxy deployments (#86)

## [1.0.3] — 2026-02-19

> ### 📊 Logs Dashboard & Real-Time Console Viewer
>
> Unified logs interface with real-time console log viewer, file-based logging via console interception, and server initialization improvements.

### ✨ Features

- **Logs Dashboard** — Consolidated 4-tab page at `/dashboard/logs` with Request Logs, Proxy Logs, Audit Logs, and Console tabs
- **Console Log Viewer** — Terminal-style real-time log viewer with color-coded log levels, auto-scroll, search/filtering, level filter, and 5-second polling
- **Console Interceptor** — Monkey-patches `console.log/info/warn/error/debug` at server start to capture all application output as JSON lines to `logs/application/app.log`
- **Log Rotation** — Size-based rotation and retention-based cleanup for log files

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Instrumentation consolidation** — Moved `initAuditLog()`, `cleanupExpiredLogs()`, and console interceptor initialization to Next.js `instrumentation.ts` (runs on both dev and prod server start)
- **Structured Logger file output** — `structuredLogger.ts` now also appends JSON log entries to the log file
- **Pino Logger fix** — Fixed broken mix of pino `transport` targets + manual `createWriteStream`; now uses `pino/file` transport targets exclusively with absolute paths

## [1.0.2] — 2026-02-18

> ### 🔒 Security Hardening, Architecture Improvements & UX Polish
>
> Comprehensive audit-driven improvements across security, architecture, testing, and user experience.

### 🛡️ Security (Phase 0)

- **Auth guard** — API route protection via `withAuth` middleware for all dashboard routes
- **CSRF protection** — Token-based CSRF guard for all state-changing API routes
- **Request payload validation** — Zod schemas for provider, combo, key, and settings endpoints
- **Prompt injection guard** — Input sanitization against malicious prompt patterns
- **Body size guard** — Route-specific body size limits with dedicated audio upload threshold
- **Rate limiter** — Per-IP rate limiting with configurable windows and thresholds

### 🏗️ Architecture (Phase 1–2)

- **DI container** — Simple dependency injection container for service registration
- **Policy engine** — Consolidated `PolicyEngine` for routing, security, and rate limiting
- **SQLite migration** — Database migration system with versioned migration runner
- **Graceful shutdown** — Clean server shutdown with connection draining
- **TypeScript fixes** — Resolved all `tsc` errors; removed redundant `@ts-check` directives

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-02-18

> ### 🔧 API Compatibility & SDK Hardening
>
> Response sanitization, role normalization, and structured output improvements for strict OpenAI SDK compatibility and cross-provider robustness.

### 🛡️ Response Sanitization (NEW)

- **Response sanitizer module** — New `responseSanitizer.ts` strips non-standard fields (`x_groq`, `usage_breakdown`, `service_tier`, etc.) from all OpenAI-format provider responses, fixing OpenAI Python SDK v1.83+ Pydantic validation failures that returned raw strings instead of parsed `ChatCompletion` objects
- **Streaming chunk sanitization** — Passthrough streaming mode now sanitizes each SSE chunk in real-time via `sanitizeStreamingChunk()`, ensuring strict `chat.completion.chunk` schema compliance
- **ID/Object/Usage normalization** — Ensures `id`, `object`, `created`, `model`, `choices`, and `usage` fields always exist with correct types
- **Usage field cleanup** — Strips non-standard usage sub-fields, keeps only `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`, and OpenAI detail fields

### 🧠 Think Tag Extraction (NEW)

- **`<think>` tag extraction** — Automatically extracts `<think>...</think>` blocks from thinking model responses (DeepSeek R1, Kimi K2 Thinking, etc.) into OpenAI's standard `reasoning_content` field
- **Streaming think-tag stripping** — Real-time `<think>` extraction in passthrough SSE stream, preventing JSON parsing errors in downstream tools
- **Preserves native reasoning** — Providers that already send `reasoning_content` natively (e.g., OpenAI o1) are not overwritten

### 🔄 Role Normalization (NEW)

- **`developer` → `system` conversion** — OpenAI's new `developer` role is automatically converted to `system` for all non-OpenAI providers (Claude, Gemini, Kiro, etc.)
- **`system` → `user` merging** — For models that reject the `system` role (GLM, ERNIE), system messages are intelligently merged into the first user message with clear delimiters
- **Model-aware normalization** — Uses model name prefix matching (`glm-*`, `ernie-*`) for compatibility decisions, avoiding hardcoded provider-level flags

### 📐 Structured Output for Gemini (NEW)

- **`response_format` → Gemini conversion** — OpenAI's `json_schema` structured output is now translated to Gemini's `responseMimeType` + `responseSchema` in the translator pipeline
- **`json_object` support** — `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` maps to Gemini's `application/json` MIME type
- **Schema cleanup** — Automatically removes unsupported JSON Schema keywords (`$schema`, `additionalProperties`) for Gemini compatibility

## [1.0.0] — 2026-02-18

> ### 🎉 First Major Release — OmniRoute 1.0
>
> OmniRoute is an intelligent API gateway that unifies 20+ AI providers behind a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint. This release represents the culmination of the entire development effort — from initial prototype to production-ready platform.

### 🧠 Core Routing & Intelligence

- **Smart 4-tier fallback** — Auto-routing: Subscription → Cheap → Free → Emergency
- **6 routing strategies** — Fill First, Round Robin, Power-of-Two-Choices, Random, Least Used, Cost Optimized
- **Semantic caching** — Auto-cache responses for deduplication with configurable TTL
- **Request idempotency** — Prevent duplicate processing of identical requests
- **Thinking budget validation** — Control reasoning token allocation per request
- **System prompt injection** — Configurable global system prompts for all requests

### 🔌 Providers & Models

- **20+ AI providers** — OpenAI, Claude (Anthropic), Gemini, GitHub Copilot, DeepSeek, Groq, xAI, Mistral, Qwen, iFlow, Kiro, OpenRouter, GLM, MiniMax, Kimi, NVIDIA NIM, and more
- **Multi-account support** — Multiple accounts per provider with automatic rotation
- **OAuth 2.0 (PKCE)** — Automatic token management and refresh for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot, Kiro
- **Auto token refresh** — Background refresh with expiry detection and unrecoverable error handling
- **Model import** — Import models from API-compatible passthrough providers
- **OpenAI-compatible validation** — Fallback validation via chat completions for providers without `/models` endpoint
- **TLS fingerprint spoofing** — Browser-like TLS fingerprinting via `wreq-js` to bypass bot detection

### 🔄 Format Translation

- **Multi-format translation** — Seamless OpenAI ↔ Claude ↔ Gemini ↔ OpenAI Responses API conversion
- **Translator Playground** — 4 interactive modes:
  - **Playground** — Test format translations between any provider formats
  - **Chat Tester** — Send real requests through the proxy with visual response rendering
  - **Test Bench** — Automated batch testing across multiple providers
  - **Live Monitor** — Real-time stream of active proxy requests and translations

### 🎯 Combos & Fallback Chains

- **Custom combos** — Create model combinations with multi-provider fallback chains
- **6 combo balancing strategies** — Fill First, Round Robin, Random, Least Used, P2C, Cost Optimized
- **Combo circuit breaker** — Auto-disable failing providers within a combo chain

### 🛡️ Resilience & Security

- **Circuit breakers** — Auto-recovery with configurable thresholds and cooldown periods
- **Exponential backoff** — Progressive retry delays for failed requests
- **Anti-thundering herd** — Mutex-based protection against concurrent retry storms
- **Rate limit detection** — Per-provider RPM, min gap, and max concurrent request tracking
- **Editable rate limits** — Configurable defaults via Settings → Resilience with persistence
- **Prompt injection guard** — Input sanitization for malicious prompt patterns
- **PII redaction** — Automatic detection and masking of personally identifiable information
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** — Credential encryption at rest
- **IP access control** — Whitelist/blacklist IP filtering
- **SOCKS5 proxy support** — Outbound proxy for upstream provider calls

### 📊 Observability & Analytics

- **Analytics dashboard** — Recharts-based SVG charts: stat cards, model usage bar chart, provider breakdown table with success rates and latency
- **Real-time health monitoring** — Provider health, rate limits, latency telemetry
- **Request logs** — Dedicated page with SQLite-persisted proxy request/response logs
- **Limits & Quotas** — Separate dashboard for quota monitoring with reset countdowns
- **Cost analytics** — Token cost tracking and budget management per provider
- **Request telemetry** — Correlation IDs, structured logging, request timing

### 💾 Database & Backup

- **Dual database** — LowDB (JSON) for config + SQLite for domain state and proxy logs
- **Export database** — `GET /api/db-backups/export` — Download SQLite database file
- **Export all** — `GET /api/db-backups/exportAll` — Full backup as `.tar.gz` archive (DB + settings + combos + providers + masked API keys)
- **Import database** — `POST /api/db-backups/import` — Upload and restore with validation, integrity check, and pre-import backup
- **Automatic backups** — Configurable backup schedule with retention
- **Storage health** — Dashboard widget with database size, path, and backup status

### 🖥️ Dashboard & UI

- **Full dashboard** — Provider management, analytics, health monitoring, settings, CLI tools
- **9 dashboard sections** — Providers, Combos, Analytics, Health, Translator, Settings, CLI Tools, Usage, Endpoint
- **Settings restructure** — 6 tabs: Security, Routing, Resilience, AI, System/Storage, Advanced
- **Shared UI component library** — Reusable components (Avatar, Badge, Button, Card, DataTable, Modal, etc.)
- **Dark/Light/System theme** — Persistent theme selection with system preference detection
- **Agent showcase grid** — Visual grid of 10 AI coding agents in README header
- **Provider logos** — Logo assets for all supported agents and providers
- **Red shield badges** — Styled badge icons across all documentation

### ☁️ Deployment & Infrastructure
